ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

Question1: What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

Answer:

（1） probability of two-head outcome: 25%
     probability of two-tail outcome: 25%
     probability of head-tail outcome: 50%
 
 (2) because it contain two cases: (first toss:Head second toss:Tail) and (first toss:Tail second toss:Head) so it will be two times more than two-heads and two-tails. 



Question2: Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

Answer: around 5000 trials



Question3:Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually works for very large values that are within the limits. Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results (probably slower on aludra than on you own machine).
